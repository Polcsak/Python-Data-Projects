## Data-driven Suggestions for HR Overview

### Business Scenario and Problem

The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They have collected data from employees but are unsure how to proceed. As a data analytics professional, you are asked to provide data-driven suggestions based on the collected data. 

The main question the HR department wants to answer is:
> Whatâ€™s likely to make an employee leave the company?

Your goal is to analyze the data collected by the HR department and build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their decision. Since it is time-consuming and costly to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be highly beneficial to the company.
