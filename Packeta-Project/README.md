# Z-Boxes Case Study (Packeta)

## 1. Introduction

Our Chief Network Officer (CNO) came to your desk and asked you to help him with deciding where to place **3,000 new Z-Boxes**. 

CNOâ€™s main task is to run sales teams which find and contract attractive locations for new boxes in order to achieve their maximum utilization. 

Your task is to recommend **how many new boxes** they should build in each **District (City)** considering:
- the population size
- already existing box infrastructure.

Please segment the municipalities into **4-5 categories** based on the population size.

---

Towards the end of your conversation, CNO also asked you to prepare a list of **main criteria** his team should consider when selecting specific locations for Z-Boxes.

---

You have been provided with a list of existing Z-Boxes. Any other data you will need to obtain by yourself.
