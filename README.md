# Python Data Case Studies

This repository contains an end-to-end data science project focused on solving a real-world business problem using data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

The main goal of the project is to:
- Understand the business context and identify the key question.
- Explore and prepare data through cleaning and visualization.
- Build predictive models to support data-driven decision-making.
- Communicate findings and recommendations to non-technical stakeholders.

Each project follows a structured workflow inspired by standard data science practices:

## Project Workflow

1. **Business Understanding**  
   Understanding the background, stakeholders, and goals.

2. **Data Understanding**  
   Exploring the available data and identifying key variables.

3. **Data Preparation**  
   Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualizing relationships, detecting patterns, and generating insights.

5. **Modeling**  
   Building regression, classification, or clustering models depending on the case.

6. **Evaluation**  
   Evaluating model performance and interpreting results.

7. **Communication**  
   Presenting actionable insights and recommendations to stakeholders.
