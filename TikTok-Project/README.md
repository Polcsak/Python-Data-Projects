# TikTok Case Study

## Background on the TikTok Scenario

Welcome to your new role at TikTok! Weâ€™re thrilled to have you on the data team!

At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow your career.

TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly.

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.


### 1. Planning Phase
- Defined the project scope, goals, and deliverables.
- Identified key stakeholders and responsibilities.
- Prepared a project proposal following the PACE methodology.

### 2. Analysis Phase
- Imported and cleaned TikTok dataset.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Generated descriptive statistics.
- Created visualizations to understand relationships between variables.

### 3. Construction Phase
- Conducted hypothesis testing.
- Built a regression model to investigate relationships between variables.
- Built a machine learning classification model to predict whether a comment contains a claim or is just an opinion.
- Evaluated the models and interpreted results.

### 4. Execution Phase
- Delivered final insights and visualizations.
- Prepared recommendations for improving the moderation process using the model's results.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

## Goal

The final goal was to support TikTok's data and moderation teams by:
- Reducing the manual review workload.
- Prioritizing reports based on model predictions.
- Gaining insights into the nature of user-reported content.
