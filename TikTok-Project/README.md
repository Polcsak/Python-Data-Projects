# TikTok Case Study

This project focuses on building a predictive model for classifying TikTok video comments, based on the PACE methodology. The main objective is to assist TikTok moderators by automating the classification of user reports and comments to prioritize moderation tasks more efficiently.

## Project Overview

The project follows a structured data science workflow consisting of:

### 1. Planning Phase
- Defined the project scope, goals, and deliverables.
- Identified key stakeholders and responsibilities.
- Prepared a project proposal following the PACE methodology.

### 2. Analysis Phase
- Imported and cleaned TikTok dataset.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Generated descriptive statistics.
- Created visualizations to understand relationships between variables.

### 3. Construction Phase
- Conducted hypothesis testing.
- Built a regression model to investigate relationships between variables.
- Built a machine learning classification model to predict whether a comment contains a claim or is just an opinion.
- Evaluated the models and interpreted results.

### 4. Execution Phase
- Delivered final insights and visualizations.
- Prepared recommendations for improving the moderation process using the model's results.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

## Goal

The final goal was to support TikTok's data and moderation teams by:
- Reducing the manual review workload.
- Prioritizing reports based on model predictions.
- Gaining insights into the nature of user-reported content.
