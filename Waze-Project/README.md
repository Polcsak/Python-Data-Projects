## Project Purpose

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. 

An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as:

- Who are the users most likely to churn?
- Why do users churn?
- When do users churn?

For example, if Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may simply lose these users without knowing why.
